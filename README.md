With natural light, sun and light from lantern, the enviorment is a mute pastel color. in artifical light, flash light, electric lights, the the enviorment is a bright vibrant color. the bulk of the game has a gray scale tone. 

GK is tasked to restore the power to the estate. either one long night, or set in different days for different areas. GK has invetory for certain items. however the Lantern and Powercells require two hands to carry. the lore or history of the estate is found in items or notes around the house. the main game doesnt require to understand the lore.

there are (amount) of power cells that represent part of the estate. GK goes around and cleans area, finds the powercell, returns it to the c orrect area. this will progress the game. once all the powercells are restored... (insert ending) (occult) (neverending story)
